# Real Time Netwok Monitor
## Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic for Cybersecurity using Machine Learning

In the rapidly evolving field of cybersecurity, the detection of anomalous activities within network traffic has become paramount to safeguarding digital assets. The escalating sophistication of cyber threats demands an advanced solution to proactively identify and mitigate potential security breaches. Traditional rule-based methods are often inadequate in adapting to the complexities of modern network traffic. This project addresses the critical need for an efficient and automated Anomaly Detection system using Machine Learning to differentiate normal network behavior from potentially malicious activities, providing cybersecurity professionals with the means to swiftly respond to and mitigate security incidents.

## Key Features of the Project:

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - The project leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models, such as Isolation Forests, One-Class SVM, or Ensemble methods, to discern patterns and anomalies within network traffic. These models are trained on labeled data to distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior.

- **Real-time Monitoring System:**
  - An integral feature is the implementation of a real-time monitoring system that continuously analyzes incoming network traffic. This system promptly detects anomalies, providing a proactive approach to cybersecurity by minimizing response time to potential security incidents.

- **Alerting Mechanism:**
  - The project incorporates a robust alerting mechanism to promptly notify administrators when anomalies are detected. Customizable alert thresholds based on anomaly severity ensure that security teams can prioritize and respond effectively to potential threats.

- **User-friendly Interface:**
  - A user-friendly interface is developed for administrators to visualize network traffic, detected anomalies, and forensic analysis results. This interface provides intuitive tools for investigation and response to security incidents, enhancing overall user experience.

- **Integration with Cyber Forensics:**
  - Principles of cyber forensics are integrated into the project, enabling a more in-depth analysis of detected anomalies. The system facilitates the reconstruction of potential attack paths and gathers forensic evidence for a comprehensive understanding of security incidents.

- **Scalability and Adaptability:**
  - The project is designed to be scalable and adaptable to changes in the network environment. It accommodates updates, expansions, or modifications in infrastructure, ensuring continuous and effective anomaly detection.

- **Advanced Analytics Principles:**
  - The system employs advanced analytics principles to identify complex patterns and anomalies within network traffic. This ensures a nuanced understanding of potential threats beyond simple rule-based approaches.

- **Machine Learning Tool Integration:**
  - Machine learning tools such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow are utilized for efficient model training and inference. This integration enhances the accuracy and reliability of the anomaly detection system.
